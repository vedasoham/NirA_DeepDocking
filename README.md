# Deep Docking-Based Virtual Screening for NirA Inhibitors

This repository implements a deep learning-guided virtual screening protocol for identifying potential inhibitors of the **NirA protein**, using an ultra-large chemical library. The workflow is based on the original Deep Docking framework by [James Gleave](https://github.com/jamesgleave/DD_protocol), modified and optimized for phytochemical screening against NirA, a key enzyme of interest in this study.

## ðŸ§  Overview of the Protocol

The methodology combines deep neural network-based filtering with molecular docking to rapidly prioritize promising binders from a massive compound library.

### Key Steps:
1. **Sampling from Library**: Compounds are sampled from public databases (ZINC, DUDE, IMPPAT, COCONUT).
2. **Data Preparation**: Decoys and actives are prepared based on molecular weight and activity criteria.
3. **Dataset Split**: ~9 million phytochemicals are split into:
   - Training
   - Validation
   - Testing
4. **Deep Neural Network Training**:
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Training set size optimization
   - Model selection
5. **Virtual Screening**:
   - Predict docking scores
   - Discard low-score compounds
   - Retain top hits as *virtual hits*
6. **Validation**: Top hits are validated using molecular docking against the NirA protein.
7. **Iterative Refinement**: Top compounds are re-scored, re-trained, and filtered in successive rounds.

## ðŸ“Š Results Summary
- **Library Size**: ~9 million
- **Top Scoring Hits**: 44,168 compounds
- **Databases**: ZINC, DUDE, IMPPAT, COCONUT
- **Architecture**: Feed-forward Deep Neural Network with hyperparameter tuning and iterative refinement
